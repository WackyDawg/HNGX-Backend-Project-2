## ‚ùØ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install yarn globally

```bash
yarn global add yarn
```


### Step 2: Create new Project

Fork or download this project. Configure your package.json for your new project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you have to add your database connection information.

Create a new database with the name you have in your `.env`-file.

Then setup your application environment.


Go to the project dir and start your app with this yarn script.

```bash
yarn start serve
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the server according to these changes.
> The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

### Install

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`



### Tests

- Run the e2e tests using `npm test`.

### Running in dev mode

- Run `npm start` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.
- The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

## ‚ùØ API Routes

The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file.
The swagger and the monitor route can be altered in the `.env` file.

| Route          | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **/api**       | When a POST request is made to this endpoint with the body parameter it inserts the data to the cloud servers. |
| **/api/:userID**   | Allowed request GET,PUT,DELETE   |

## ‚ùØ Postman
Use Postman for testing the API. You can use any client :). So open postman and create a new post request to http://localhost:3000/api with this in the body

```bash
{
  "name": "Clark Kent"
}
```
![create user using POST](./images/create-user.png)
```bash
POST /api
```
## ‚ùØ POST Request Response
```bash
{
    "message": "Person created successfullyüéâ",
    "newPerson": {
        "_id": "6502152763bcef1970ba0a28",
        "name": "Clark Kent",
        "__v": 0
    }
}
```
